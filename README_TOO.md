# Threat Modelling Case Study: Online Banking Application

This repository demonstrates a **threat modelling approach** using both **STRIDE** and **MITRE ATT&CK** frameworks.  
The case study is based on a **Banking App** and includes threat diagrams, detailed analysis, and mitigation strategies.  

---

##  Contents
- **diagrams/** → Threat flow diagrams (DFDs, attack flows).  
- **stride-analysis/** → STRIDE threat modelling for the banking app.  
- **mitre-attack-mapping/** → ATT&CK techniques mapped to threats.  
- **cases/** → Example scenarios and case studies.  
- **output/** → Summarized results and recommendations.  

---

##  Usage
1. Review the STRIDE analysis to understand potential threats.  
2. Check the MITRE ATT&CK mapping for real-world tactics/techniques.  
3. Use the results in `output/` to align with defensive security measures.
