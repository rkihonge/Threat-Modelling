# Threat Modelling Case Study: Online Banking App

This project demonstrates how to perform threat modelling on a **banking application** using the **STRIDE framework** and **MITRE ATT&CK mapping**. The case study is based on a **Banking App** and includes threat diagrams, detailed analysis, and mitigation strategies.

## Objectives
- Identify security threats using STRIDE.
- Map potential attacker techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Provide a structured case study that can serve as a learning resource.

## Contents
- **STRIDE_case_study.md** → Detailed STRIDE analysis for a banking app.
- **MITRE_mapping.md** → Mapping of identified threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.
- **diagrams/** → Threat flow diagrams (DFDs, attack flows).  
- **stride-analysis/** → STRIDE threat modelling for the banking app.  
- **mitre-attack-mapping/** → ATT&CK techniques mapped to threats.  
- **cases/** → Example scenarios and case studies.  
- **output/** → Summarized results and recommendations. 
- **diagrams/**

##  Usage
1. Review the STRIDE analysis to understand potential threats.  
2. Check the MITRE ATT&CK mapping for real-world tactics/techniques.  
3. Use the results in `output/` to align with defensive security measures.

## Why This Matters
Banking systems are a prime target for cyberattacks due to their sensitive financial data and critical services. Threat modelling provides proactive defense strategies by highlighting risks before they are exploited.

##  Value
This repo can be used to:
- Practice **threat modelling** for secure app design.  
- Show understanding of **security frameworks** on GitHub.  
- Provide a structured template for real-world client scenarios.
