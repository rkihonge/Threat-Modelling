# Threat Modelling Case Study: Online Banking App

This project demonstrates how to perform threat modelling on a **banking application** using the **STRIDE framework** and **MITRE ATT&CK mapping**.

## Objectives
- Identify security threats using STRIDE.
- Map potential attacker techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- Provide a structured case study that can serve as a learning resource.

## Contents
- **STRIDE_case_study.md** → Detailed STRIDE analysis for a banking app.
- **MITRE_mapping.md** → Mapping of identified threats to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.

## Why This Matters
Banking systems are a prime target for cyberattacks due to their sensitive financial data and critical services. Threat modelling provides proactive defense strategies by highlighting risks before they are exploited.
